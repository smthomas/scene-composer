## What is Scene Composer?

Scene Composer is a React-based tool designed to help creators generate more detailed and structured prompts for Google's Veo3 video generation model. Instead of writing complex prompts manually, you can:

- üìù Build multi-segment video sequences visually
- üé® Configure style, camera movements, and environments
- ‚è±Ô∏è Set precise timing for each scene
- üì§ Export to YAML format ready for Veo3
- üíæ Save and manage your prompt library locally (using localstorage)

## Features

- **Visual Timeline Builder**: Drag and drop segments to create your video sequence
- **Rich Metadata Controls**: Set video style, environment, camera settings, and more
- **Real-time YAML Preview**: See your prompt structure as you build
- **Local Storage**: Save your favorite prompts for later use
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes during those late-night creative sessions
- **No Backend Required**: Everything runs in your browser
